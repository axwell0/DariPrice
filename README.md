# DariPrice: House & Apartment Pricing Model for Tunisian Real Estate

DariPrice is a machine learning project aimed at predicting real estate prices (both houses and apartments) in Tunisia.

By scraping real estate listings from Affare.tn and Menzili.tn, the project builds a predictive model that estimates property prices using various features.

A web app is deployed on Railway to allow usage of our trained model: https://dariprice.up.railway.app
